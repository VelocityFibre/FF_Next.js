 * - scoreCalculator.ts      - Score calculation logic
 * - benchmarkCalculator.ts  - Benchmarking and trends
 * - recommendationGenerator.ts - Improvement recommendations
 * - utils.ts               - Common utilities
 * - types.ts               - Type definitions
 * 
 * Use: import { ScorecardService } from './scorecard';
 * Legacy compatibility: import { ScorecardGenerator } from './scorecard';
