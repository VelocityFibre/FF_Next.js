 * StorageService - Legacy Compatibility Layer
 * @deprecated Use imports from @/services/core/storage instead

 * This file provides backward compatibility for existing imports.
 * New code should import directly from the modular structure:
 * - import { storageService } from '@/services/core/storage'
 * 
 * Original file: 333 lines â†’ Split into focused modules

// Export as default for backward compatibility
