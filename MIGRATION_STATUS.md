# Next.js + Clerk Migration Status

## Overview
FibreFlow is being migrated from React/Vite/Firebase to Next.js/Clerk for improved performance, better authentication, and enhanced developer experience.

## Migration Strategy
- **Incremental Migration**: Running both apps in parallel during transition
- **Database Unchanged**: Neon PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM remains the same
- **API Migration**: Express routes being converted to Next.js API routes
- **Auth Migration**: Firebase Auth â†’ Clerk

## Directory Structure
```

â”œâ”€â”€ api/                    # Express API (being migrated)
â”œâ”€â”€ nextjs-migration/       # New Next.js app (in progress)

## Migration Progress

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Next.js project setup
- [x] Clerk authentication integration
- [x] Database connection (Neon + Drizzle)
- [x] Middleware configuration

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] Route migration (React Router â†’ Next.js App Router)
- [ ] API migration (Express â†’ Next.js API routes)
- [ ] Component migration
- [ ] State management migration

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- [ ] Testing setup for Next.js
- [ ] Deployment configuration
- [ ] Data migration scripts
- [ ] Feature parity verification
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Gradual traffic migration

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Current (React/Vite) | Target (Next.js) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| Framework | React 18 + Vite | Next.js 14+ |
| Routing | React Router | App Router |
| Auth | Firebase Auth | Clerk |
| API | Express server | Next.js API routes |
| Styling | TailwindCSS | TailwindCSS (unchanged) |
| Database | Neon + Drizzle | Neon + Drizzle (unchanged) |
| Deployment | Vercel (SPA) | Vercel (SSR/ISR) |

## Development Workflow

### Working on Current App
```bash
cd /home/louisdup/VF/Apps/FF_React
npm run dev  # Runs React + Express
```

### Working on Migration
```bash
cd /home/louisdup/VF/Apps/FF_React/nextjs-migration
npm run dev  # Runs Next.js with Clerk
```

## Important Notes for Developers

1. **New Features**: Consider implementing in Next.js migration instead of React app
2. **Authentication**: All new auth work should use Clerk patterns
3. **API Routes**: New API endpoints should be Next.js API routes
4. **Database**: Continue using Drizzle ORM - schema remains the same
5. **Components**: New components should be compatible with both systems during migration
