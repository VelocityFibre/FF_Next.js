## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Agent Coordination Framework

#### Browser MCP Session Management
- **Primary Sessions**: Each agent gets dedicated Browser MCP session
- **Session Isolation**: Separate browser profiles to prevent data contamination
- **Resource Sharing**: Centralized screenshot and evidence collection
- **Synchronization Points**: Defined checkpoints for dependent tests

#### Database State Management
- **Read-Only Agents**: Can execute simultaneously (dashboard, reports, analytics)
- **Write-Heavy Agents**: Sequenced to prevent conflicts (staff, projects, contractors)
- **Snapshot Strategy**: Database state captured before each major phase
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick recovery from data corruption

#### Conflict Resolution
```javascript
// Agent Execution Matrix
const executionGroups = {
  Group1_ReadOnly: ['dashboard-validator', 'reports-validator', 'analytics-validator'],
  Group2_AuthFlow: ['auth-security-validator', 'navigation-validator'],
  Group3_ProjectData: ['project-validator', 'sow-validator'],
  Group4_UserData: ['staff-validator', 'client-validator'],
  Group5_Operations: ['contractor-validator', 'procurement-validator'],
  Group6_Field: ['field-operations-validator', 'pole-tracker-validator', 'drops-validator'],
  Group7_Integration: ['integration-validator', 'performance-validator', 'security-validator']
};
```

### Execution Workflow

#### Phase 1: Sequential Execution (Foundation)
```bash
# Critical foundation tests run sequentially
infrastructure-validator → auth-security-validator → navigation-validator → performance-validator
```

#### Phase 2-3: Parallel Execution (Core Testing)
```bash
# Group A: Data Creation (Sequential within group)
project-validator → sow-validator
staff-validator → client-validator → contractor-validator

# Group B: System Validation (Parallel)
dashboard-validator || reports-validator || field-operations-validator

# Group C: Complex Operations (Sequential)
procurement-validator → pole-tracker-validator → drops-validator
```

#### Phase 4-5: Mixed Execution (Integration & Validation)
```bash
# Integration tests require all data in place
integration-validator (Sequential, after all core tests)

# Final validation can run in parallel
security-validator || performance-validator || documentation-validator
```

### Resource Allocation Strategy

#### Browser Resources
- **Chromium**: Primary testing browser for all agents
- **Firefox**: Secondary validation for critical workflows
- **Mobile Viewports**: Specific agents assigned mobile testing
- **Parallel Limit**: Maximum 6 concurrent browser sessions

#### Database Connections
- **Read Pool**: 8 connections for read-only operations
- **Write Pool**: 2 connections for data modification
- **Admin Pool**: 1 connection for database management
- **Connection Cycling**: Automatic cleanup every 30 minutes

#### Screenshot Management
- **Centralized Storage**: All agents write to shared evidence folder
- **Naming Convention**: `{agent-name}_{timestamp}_{test-scenario}.png`
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old screenshots removed after successful test completion
- **Evidence Correlation**: Screenshots linked to specific test failures
