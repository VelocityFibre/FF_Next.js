## üéØ REMAINING FOCUSED WORK

### **Low-Priority Issues (Non-Blocking):**
1. **TypeScript warnings**: 24 remaining (isolated modules)
   - Procurement permission classes need definitions
   - Stock analytics type mismatches
   - Circular reference in StockErrorFormatter

2. **ESLint warnings**: 1,584 style/convention warnings
   - Mostly `any` types that should be specific
   - React hooks dependency arrays
   - Code style preferences

3. **Test Infrastructure**: Playwright configuration conflicts
   - Lower priority due to application stability
   - Can be addressed in dedicated testing sprint
