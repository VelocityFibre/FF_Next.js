## 📋 **Available Deployment Workflows**

### **Workflow 1: Simple Production**
```
Build → Test → Deploy → Health Check → (Rollback if failed)
```

### **Workflow 2: Staging → Production**
```
Build → Deploy to Staging → Test → Manual Approval → Deploy to Production → Health Check
```

### **Workflow 3: Multi-Environment**
```
Build → Deploy to Dev → Deploy to Staging → Approval → Deploy to Production → Monitor
```

### **Workflow 4: Hotfix Emergency**
```
Minimal Tests → Fast Build → Direct to Production → Critical Health Check
```

### **Workflow 5: Rollback Recovery**
```
Identify Issue → Find Last Good Version → Execute Rollback → Verify → Notify
```

- Deploy: npm run deploy:prod
- Full testing + manual approval required
```

## 🎉 **Now You Have 8 Agents Total!**

1. **PlannerAgent** - Task planning and breakdown
2. **ArchitectAgent** - System design and architecture
3. **CoderAgent** - Code implementation
4. **TesterAgent** - Quality assurance and testing
5. **ReviewerAgent** - Code review and validation
6. **AntiHallucinationAgent** - Truth validation
7. **CoordinatorAgent** - Multi-agent coordination
8. **DeploymentAgent** - CI/CD and DevOps ⭐ **NEW!**

## 🚀 **What This Solves**

### **Your Original Question Extended:**
> "so the coordinator will handle all deployment and github functions including cpd?"

**Answer**: 
- **CoordinatorAgent**: Handles multi-agent coordination + GitHub PR creation
- **DeploymentAgent**: Handles all CI/CD, deployment, and DevOps operations

### **Complete Solution:**
- ✅ **Multi-agent coordination** (CoordinatorAgent)
- ✅ **CI/CD automation** (DeploymentAgent)  
- ✅ **GitHub integration** (Both agents)
- ✅ **Deployment pipelines** (DeploymentAgent)
- ✅ **Quality gates** (All agents working together)
- ✅ **Rollback and recovery** (DeploymentAgent)

## 📝 **Next Steps**

### **To Use DeploymentAgent:**

1. **Simple Deployment:**
```bash
python deployment_demo.py
```

2. **Setup CI/CD Pipeline:**
```python
# The agent can create GitHub Actions workflows
