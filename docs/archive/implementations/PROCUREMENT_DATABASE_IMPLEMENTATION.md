# Procurement Module - Database Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure implementation for the FibreFlow Procurement Portal Module, specifically Task 1.1: Database Schema & Models.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All foundational database components have been successfully implemented and are ready for integration with the rest of the procurement module.

## 🏗️ Architecture Analysis

### Existing FibreFlow Structure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon cloud hosting
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with TypeScript
- **Patterns**: Project-scoped data isolation with Firebase project IDs
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime validation
- **Migration**: Drizzle Kit for schema management

### Integration Approach
- Extended existing `schema.ts` with procurement tables
- Followed established naming conventions and patterns
- Maintained project-scoping for multi-tenancy
- Preserved existing foreign key relationship patterns

## 📊 Database Schema Implementation

### Core Tables Created

#### BOQ (Bill of Quantities) Management
1. **`boqs`** - Main BOQ entities with versioning and approval workflow
2. **`boq_items`** - Individual line items with catalog mapping
3. **`boq_exceptions`** - Mapping exceptions and resolution tracking

#### RFQ (Request for Quote) System  
4. **`rfqs`** - RFQ entities with supplier management and evaluation
5. **`rfq_items`** - Items requested in RFQs with technical requirements
6. **`supplier_invitations`** - Supplier invitation tracking with authentication
7. **`quotes`** - Supplier quote responses with evaluation scores
8. **`quote_items`** - Individual quoted items with pricing and alternatives
9. **`quote_documents`** - Supporting documents for quotes

#### Stock Management
10. **`stock_positions`** - Real-time inventory positions by project
11. **`stock_movements`** - All stock movements (ASN, GRN, Issue, Return, Transfer)
12. **`stock_movement_items`** - Individual items in movements with lot tracking
13. **`cable_drums`** - Specialized cable drum tracking with meter readings
14. **`drum_usage_history`** - Historical usage tracking for cable drums

### Key Design Decisions

#### Project Scoping
- All tables include `project_id` for multi-tenant data isolation
- Foreign key relationships ensure data integrity
- Denormalized `project_id` in child tables for performance

#### Status Management
- Comprehensive enum-based status tracking
- Separate mapping and procurement status for BOQ items
- Workflow-aware statuses for approval processes

#### Financial Tracking
- Decimal precision for monetary values (15,2)
- Multi-currency support with ZAR default
- Price comparison and variance tracking

#### Audit & Compliance
- Complete audit trail with created/updated timestamps
- User tracking for all modifications
- Document management with file metadata

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Features
- **27 total tables** (14 new procurement tables + 13 existing)
- **Project-scoped indexing** for optimal query performance
- **Comprehensive foreign key relationships** ensuring data integrity
- **Enum-based status management** for workflow control
- **JSON columns** for flexible specifications and metadata
- **Decimal precision** for accurate financial calculations

### TypeScript Integration
- **Full type safety** with inferred types from database schema
- **Drizzle ORM integration** with auto-generated TypeScript types
- **Barrel exports** in type files for clean imports
- **Legacy compatibility** with existing type structures

### Validation Framework
- **Comprehensive Zod schemas** for all entities
- **Form validation schemas** for UI integration
- **API validation utilities** with detailed error handling
- **Runtime type checking** with transformation support

### Seed Data
- **Realistic test scenarios** covering full procurement lifecycle
- **Relational integrity** with proper ID relationships
- **Multiple project contexts** for testing multi-tenancy
- **Complete workflow examples** from BOQ to stock delivery

## 🚀 Migration & Deployment

### Migration Status
- ✅ Schema defined and validated
- ✅ Migration file generated (`0000_shallow_cyclops.sql`)
- ⏳ Database push pending (requires `VITE_NEON_DATABASE_URL`)

### To Deploy:
1. Set up Neon database connection URL in `.env`
2. Run `npm run db:push` to apply schema
3. Optionally run seed data import for testing

### Database Commands
```bash
# Generate new migration
npm run db:generate

# Push schema to database  
npm run db:push

# Open database studio
npm run db:studio

# Validate schema
npm run db:validate
```

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Existing FibreFlow Services
- **Authentication**: Uses existing user IDs from Firebase Auth
- **Projects**: References existing project IDs from Firebase
- **File Storage**: Integrates with existing file upload patterns
- **Audit Logging**: Extends existing audit log table

### External Dependencies
- **Suppliers**: External supplier management (to be integrated)
- **Catalog**: Product catalog for BOQ mapping (to be implemented)
- **Notifications**: Email service for RFQ invitations
- **Workflow**: Approval workflow engine integration
