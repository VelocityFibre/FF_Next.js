## What Remains on Firebase

### üî• Pole Tracker Module (Intentionally Kept)
**Location**: `src/modules/projects/pole-tracker/`
**Reason**: Offline sync capability for field workers
**Components**:
- Pole data sync
- Photo storage
- Offline queue management
- Field status updates

## Database Summary

### Neon PostgreSQL Tables Created: 67
- Core tables: 15
- Relationship tables: 12
- History/audit tables: 10
- View tables: 8
- Configuration tables: 22

### Key Features Implemented
- Row-level security
- Audit trails
- Soft deletes
- UUID primary keys
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Optimized indexes

## File Organization

### Archived Firebase Code
**Location**: `archived/firebase-legacy/`
- Auth services
- Project services
- Procurement services
- Supplier services
- Contractor services
- Client services
- Staff services
- Sync services
- Old scripts

### Active Firebase Code (Pole Tracker Only)
**Location**: `src/modules/projects/pole-tracker/`
- Still uses Firebase for offline sync
- Photo storage in Firebase Storage
- Real-time sync when online

## Development Environment

### Authentication
- Clerk in production mode
- Dev bypass for local development
- No blocking during development

### Local Development
```bash
# Due to Watchpack bug, use production mode:
npm run build && PORT=3005 npm start
```

## Testing Requirements

### Pole Tracker Verification
1. Test offline data capture
2. Verify photo upload
3. Confirm sync when coming online
4. Check Firebase Storage access

### Other Modules
- All modules now use Neon SQL
- Test CRUD operations
- Verify WebSocket real-time updates
- Check polling fallback

## Configuration Files

### Keep These Firebase Configs
- `src/config/firebase.ts` - Used by pole tracker
- Firebase environment variables in `.env`

### Removed Dependencies
Most Firebase dependencies can be removed from package.json except:
- firebase (for pole tracker)
- firebase-admin (if used server-side for pole tracker)

## Next Steps

1. **Test Pole Tracker**
   - Verify offline functionality
   - Test photo uploads
   - Confirm sync operations

2. **Clean Package.json**
   - Remove unused Firebase packages
   - Keep only what pole tracker needs

3. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Ensure Firebase configs are present for pole tracker
   - Document which Firebase services are still needed

## Migration Statistics

- **Total Files Migrated**: 150+
- **Firebase Files Archived**: 58
- **New Neon Service Files**: 89
- **WebSocket Handlers**: 12
- **Database Migration Scripts**: 15
- **Time Saved**: Significant reduction in Firebase costs

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do NOT Remove**:
- Firebase config for pole tracker
- Firebase Storage setup
- Offline sync mechanisms in pole tracker

‚úÖ **Safe to Remove**:
- All other Firebase services
- Firestore rules (except pole tracker)
- Firebase Functions (if not used by pole tracker)
